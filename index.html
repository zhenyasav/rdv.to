    <p>The social network mesh for activists, neighbors, strangers and loved ones.
    <br/>Frictionless as a richer web where everything can be shared in place,
    <br/>yet true privacy controls because we need control back.
    <br/>Mobile web first, browser &amp; cloud second, always safe from technocratic cyberstalking.</p>

    <br/>you have securely joined a rendezvous.</p>
    <p>Carry an identifier from the source of your link only if you accept it,
    <br/>progressively bring a profile reflecting your facets at play,
    <br/>interact in a shared digital space enriched by apps from its creators.</p>
    <span class="icon">≙</span>
    <p>You can make new rendezvous for family &amp; friends, bakeries &amp; seminars;
    <br/>you can even prepare them for after you're gone &amp; trigger actions in your persistent absence.
    <br/>Dispose when done or archive forever!</p>
    <p>Mix and match documents &amp; apps from all over,
    <br/>leverage integrated messaging to create real connections,
    <br/>craft in advance or collaborate in real-time.</p>
    <p>You manage your identitiers, your apps, we manage the wiring.
    <br/>Embrace new identifiers at will, share only who and what you want with who you want.</p>
    <p>Each identifier can be new! Skipping last names at a festival, a QR code scan later you can go digital.<br/>Or bring ad-hoc business facades at a conference. No setup or login needed.</p>
    <span class="icon">≝</span>
    <p>Each rendezvous brings a unique experience straight from and to your contact(s), outside our control.
    <br/>Everyone can filter &amp; curate profiles, share some of their apps &amp; data their way.</p>
    <p>All web development knowledge, tools, and infrastructure transfer, and dedicated libraries assist integration.
    <br/>We support and embrace the open web!</p>
    <span class="icon">⊶</span>
    <p>We only earn real customer money, at any cost.
    <br/>Free or $10/year, later adjusted with you to follow our expenses.
    <br/>Premium offers cross-device storage &amp; sharing with a reserved name (5-30 characters),
    <br/>E-mail integration is native, optional, &amp; adaptive.</p>
    <p>The web needs smoother yet controlled micro-payments, there's a lot to be done.</p>
    <span class="icon">⨷</span>
    <p>Unless mentioned by name, identifiers are always anonymous but linkable,
    <br/>like <tt>H0Kew7NkgmhDx_o61_NcOhQpizaK4NzUxFi7SPVLsB0</tt>.
    <br/>We route your apps through anonymous connections securely on the fly.</p>
    <span class="icon">☀</span>
    <p>Our platform builds on end-to-end encryption and we only store what we need.
    <br/>Data and metadata are only used to operate the service.</p>
    <p>Nothing is shared with anyone without your explicit consent, as long as we can help it.
    <br/>Even we cannot open end-to-end encrypted data.</p>
    <p>Operating from Toronto, Ontario, Canada in compliance with local laws,
    <br/>we have not had to share anything without consent as of XXXX-XX-XX.</p>
